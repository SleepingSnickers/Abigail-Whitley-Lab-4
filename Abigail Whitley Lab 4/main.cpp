/*Create a text turn - based battle game with Java :
Allow the player to choose from a list of items and magic spells before starting the battle.
Randomly generate the stats of the enemy the player fights, and give it items and /or spells that it may decide to use on its turn.
On the player's turn, allow them to choose by selecting a number to fight, use an item, or cast a spell. Track both health points and mana.
On the enemy's turn, develop an algorithm based on the enemy's current stats to decide what to do.You may incorporate randomness in the decision.
The battle ends when either the player or the enemy's HP reaches 0*/
